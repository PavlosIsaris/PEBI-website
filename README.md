# Personalized Electrical Brain Imaging (PEBI)

  Next-generation computational tools for high spatial-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) based brain imaging technologies

# About the Project
 We envision that portable EEG-based devices will enable remote & home-based brain monitoring and communication and become as common in personalised health tracking as smart watches.

The project is temporarily hosted under GitHub pages and is available here: [https://pavlosisaris.github.io/PEBI-website/](https://pavlosisaris.github.io/PEBI-website/)
